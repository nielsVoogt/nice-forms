# nice-forms.css
#### Your CSS base setup for forms and inputs

I like pretty forms and clean HTML ðŸ˜„ That's why I created nice-forms.css. To help devs out who want to hit the ground running, but don't want to stare at those default input fields when doing so ðŸ’©

### So what does it do?
- It's a sensible input styling 'reset'
- Get nice looking forms with zero effort
- Easily customizable with css-variables
- Minimal classes or non at all
- Perfect for rapid prototyping - or tweak it and make it your own.
- No hacks or unnecessary elements, pure semantics

### Installation
